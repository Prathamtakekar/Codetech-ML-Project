# Codetech-ML-Project

This repository showcases a data science project focused on data preprocessing and machine learning using Python. The notebook provides insights into a typical machine learning workflow, covering data cleaning, feature engineering, and model preparation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project demonstrates:

- **Data Loading & Exploration:** Importing the dataset and performing initial analysis to understand its structure.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Preparation:** (If applicable) Steps to prepare a machine learning model, including splitting the data and feature selection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for analysis

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (`train.csv`, main cat/dog.csv) containing various features. It is assumed to be a structured dataset suitable for machine learning tasks.

## 📈 Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure of the data and identify potential areas for cleaning or transformation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Apply transformations such as scaling and encoding to prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Evaluation**: While the current notebook focuses on preprocessing, further analysis will include building and evaluating machine learning models.
